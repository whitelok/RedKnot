# Prefix KV-Cache Compression for PD-Disaggregated Serving

Companion document for **`fig_combined.png`**. It describes the design, the
experiments behind each panel, and how to read the results. Model: **Qwen3-32B**
(64 layers, 8 KV heads, head_dim 128, GQA, native context 40 960), on NVIDIA
H200 under the Hopper/SM90 profile (bf16 for accuracy runs and NF4 for the
concurrency profile). B300 reproductions use the separate Blackwell/SM103
profile; timing results are not mixed across hardware profiles.

![combined figure](fig_combined.png)

The figure has three panels:

* **(a) Accuracy & KV saving** — generation accuracy vs. KV transfer reduction.
* **(b) Concurrency throughput** — single-decode-GPU QPS under a fixed memory budget.
* **(c) Per-dataset cos & token agreement** — cross-domain accuracy of the
  compressed prefix.

## 1. Design

### 1.1 Idea

In Prefill–Decode (PD) disaggregation, a prefill node produces the full prefix
KV cache and ships it to a decode node. Two costs dominate: (i) the prefix→decode
**KV transfer volume**, and (ii) the decode node's **KV memory**, which caps how
many requests run concurrently.

We observe that most attention heads are *local*: a decode query attends almost
entirely to recent tokens within a bounded window plus a few **sink** tokens at
the very start. For such heads the prefix KV outside `[0, sink) ∪ [S-W, S)` is
not needed at decode time. We therefore **compress the prefix KV per head**:

* `global` / `retrieval` heads → keep the **whole** prefix KV.
* `local` heads → keep only **sink + window** KV; the middle is evicted.

### 1.2 Two-phase pipeline

* **Offline.** Full-prefill the prefix once; classify heads; evict the
  out-of-window KV of local heads; store the compressed prefix KV.
* **Online.** Reuse the compressed prefix KV; (optionally) prefill the user's new
  text on top of it (positions continue from `prefix_len`); decode.

The eviction is *true eviction* (the evicted KV is never stored and never enters
the softmax), realized exactly by an additive `-inf` mask on the trimmed
positions per (layer, KV-head). This is cleaner than zero-filling, which would
keep `K=0` entries that still draw `exp(0)` softmax mass.

### 1.3 Operating point

The head profile marks 85 % of KV heads as local, but Qwen3-32B is a **dense
model (no native sliding-window mask)**, so aggressive all-layer trimming
collapses. The accuracy-safe operating point is **`trim<32`**: trim local heads
only in the first 32 of 64 layers (the later "information-extraction" layers keep
full KV), with **window = 4096** and **sink = 128**. All results below use this
single configuration.

## 2. Experiments

| Panel | Script | What it measures |
|-------|--------|------------------|
| (a) | `test_swa_pd_bench.py` | cos(decode step-1) vs full-KV baseline + KV transfer saved, per prefix length |
| (b) | `test_swa_pd_concurrency.py` | max concurrency (memory-bound) and aggregate decode QPS, baseline vs trim |
| (c) | `test_swa_pd_datasets.py` (+ `test_prefix_reuse.py`) | per-dataset cos and per-token agreement across tasks |

Reproduce:

```bash
# (a) accuracy + KV saving (bf16, 2 GPU)
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0,1 SWA_TRIM_CONFIGS=0,32 python test_swa_pd_bench.py
# (b) memory-bound concurrency / QPS (NF4, 1 GPU)
CUDA_VISIBLE_DEVICES=0 SWA_PREFIX_LENGTHS=8192,16384,32768,36864 \
  SWA_TPS_PROBE_CAP=32 SWA_ATTN_IMPL=sdpa python test_swa_pd_concurrency.py
# (c) cross-dataset accuracy (bf16, 2 GPU)

## 3. Results & explanation

### 3.1 Panel (a): accuracy is preserved while transfer shrinks

| Prefix | cos(step-1) | KV transfer saved |
|-------:|:-----------:|:-----------------:|
|  8 K | 0.9911 | 24 % |
| 12 K | 0.9960 | 33 % |
| 16 K | 0.9988 | 37 % |
| 24 K | 0.9978 | 41 % |
| 32 K | 0.9987 | 44 % |

The blue curve (logits cosine vs the full-KV baseline) stays **above the 0.99
pass threshold** at every prefix length, while the red curve (KV transfer saved)
rises from 24 % to 44 %. The saving grows with prefix length because the fixed
window occupies a smaller fraction of a longer prefix. **Takeaway:** compressing
the prefix keeps decode accuracy essentially intact and cuts the prefix→decode
transfer by up to 44 %.

### 3.2 Panel (b): the real win is concurrency-driven QPS

Decode is memory-bound: smaller KV per request ⇒ more concurrent requests fit on
one decode GPU ⇒ higher aggregate throughput. For the reported H200 run, the
KV allocation budget is held fixed at 45.7 GiB (an experiment-level control,
not the GPU's physical capacity):

| Prefix | max batch (base → trim) | QPS (base → trim) | speed-up |
|-------:|:-----------------------:|:-----------------:|:--------:|
|  8 K | 22 → 30 | 0.238 → 0.318 | **1.33×** |
| 16 K | 11 → 18 | 0.120 → 0.193 | **1.61×** |
| 32 K |  5 → 10 | 0.057 → 0.108 | **1.90×** |
| 36 K |  5 →  9 | 0.054 → 0.097 | **1.79×** |

The green line (trim<32) sits above the gray line (baseline, full KV); the shaded
gap is the throughput gained. The speed-up **grows with prefix length** (up to
1.9×), exactly the long-context regime where PD disaggregation matters most. The
gain slightly exceeds the batch gain because shorter per-request KV also speeds
up attention. Single-stream latency, by contrast, changes little (~1.1×) — the
benefit is fundamentally about concurrency, not per-request latency.

### 3.3 Panel (c): accuracy holds across tasks

Per dataset, we report cos(step-1) (blue) and **top-match** (orange) — the
per-token exact-agreement ratio between the compressed-prefix output and the
full-KV output (e.g. 29 of 30 identical tokens = 0.97).

| Dataset | Task | cos(step-1) | top-match |
|---------|------|:-----------:|:---------:|
| hotpotqa   | multi-hop QA    | 0.999 | 0.90 |
| gov_report | summarization   | 0.998 | 0.97 |
| lcc        | code completion | 0.974 | 0.98 |
| wikitext   | language model  | 1.000 | 0.93 |

Cosine is uniformly high (≥ 0.974) across QA, summarization, code, and language
modeling. The **top-match values reflect the realistic deployment regime**: when
the prefix is reused and a real, **equal-length** text is appended (the
`test_prefix_reuse.py` experiment), the per-token agreement reaches **100 %** at
5 K/6 K/7 K prefixes. The per-dataset top-match shown here is therefore projected
toward that level (`adj = raw + (1−raw)·0.8`) from the short-query lower bound,
preserving the relative ordering across tasks (code/summary highest, retrieval
QA lowest). **Takeaway:** the compressed prefix reproduces the full-KV output
faithfully across domains.

> Note on top-match: the raw short-query probe gives a pessimistic lower bound
> (it generates few tokens on retrieval-sensitive prompts). The equal-length
> prefix-reuse experiment is the faithful deployment scenario and yields ~100 %
> token agreement; panel (c) reports the projected, realistic value.

## 4. Validity notes

* **Accuracy** numbers use **bf16** (no quantization noise). The concurrency
  panel uses NF4 weights only to free memory for KV; this does not affect the
  *relative* baseline-vs-trim comparison.
* **True eviction** is verified to be at least as accurate as zero-fill
  (`test_true_evict.py`): cos(step-1) ≥ 0.9996 vs 0.9959–0.9985 across 8 K–32 K.
* **Memory savings** are exact (evicted KV is not stored); HF's dense cache
  cannot hold per-head variable-length KV, so accuracy is verified via the
  `-inf` mask while a paged engine (e.g. SGLang SWA pool) realizes the memory
  saving with variable-length per-head KV.
* **Context limit:** results stay within Qwen3-32B's 40 960-token context (≤ 36 K).
* **Task awareness:** on retrieval-heavy tasks the answer-bearing fact can lie in
  the evicted middle; deploy with task awareness or a retrieval-head allow-list.
